# Machine Learning Specialization 

This repository contains my **Jupyter Notebook solutions** and notes from the [**Machine Learning Specialization**](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) by **DeepLearning.AI** and **Stanford University**, taught by **Andrew Ng**.  
The specialization consists of **three courses** covering foundational to advanced topics in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI.
